Experiment Support System configuration
=======================================

The settings in this section configure the Experiment Support System itself.
To work correctly, they must all be specified within the ``[app:main]``
section of the configuration file.

Application settings
--------------------

**app.title**
  The title to use for the Experiment Support System. Change this to integrate
  the system into a site-specific branding.
  
  Default: Experiment Support System

SQLAlchemy database connection string
-------------------------------------

**sqlalchemy.url**
  The SQLAlchemy database connection URL. Consult the
  `SQLAlchemy connection string`_ documentation to find the correct format
  for the database and database library you are using.
  
E-Mail settings
---------------

**email.smtp_host**
  The host-name of the SMTP server to use for sending e-mails. If this setting
  is not specified then non of the e-mail related functions in the Experiment
  Support System will be enabled.
 
Session handling configuration
------------------------------

The settings in this section specify how the user sessions are managed. For
details on the available settings, consult the `beaker documentation`_. In most
cases you will only want to change the *beaker.session.key* setting.

**beaker.session.lock_dir**
  The directory used for locking.
  
  Default: %(here)s/tmp
**beaker.session.type**
  The type of session storage to use. By default uses cookie-based sessions.
  
  Default: cookie
**beaker.session.key**
  The key to use for session access. With cookie-based sessions this is the
  name of the cookie to use.
  
  Default: ess
**beaker.session.encrypt_key**
  Encryption key to use to ensure cookie-based sessions are harder to
  manipulate. The key is automatically and semi-randomly generated when the
  configuration is created.
**beaker.session.validate_key**
  Validation key to use to test that cookie-based sessions have not been
  manipulated. The key is automatically and semi-randomly generated when the
  configuration is created.

The settings in this section are set for a production deployment and should
not be changed in a production environment.
