This sub-section explains how to:

1. editing a survey - go to relevant sub-subsection by clicking :ref:`here<editingSurveySub-subsection>`. 

2. export a survey - go to relevant sub-subsection by clicking :ref:`here<exportSurveySub-subsection>`. 

3. duplicate a survey - go to relevant sub-subsection by clicking :ref:`here<duplicateSurveySub-subsection>`.

4. delete a survey - go to relevant sub-subsection by clicking :ref:`here<deleteSurveySub-subsection>`. 

This sub-section assumes that you are in the survey you want to edit by importing, adding, exporting or deleting a page. For instructions on how to navigate to the correct survey, see :ref:`Note <topEditExportSurveySection>` mentioned above.
  
.. _editingSurveySub-subsection:

Editing a survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can edit the details of a survey you are developing, add your own CSS Styles and JavaScript code, change which of the survey pages will be the first to display, add notifications depending on specific conditions and make the survey public. 

Depending on where you are in the system, there are three ways to do the above, detailed below as (a), (b) and (c):

	(a) **If you are not already in the survey you want to edit**, see instructions provided in the :ref:`Note <topEditExportSurveySection>` at the top of this page.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	(b) **When you reach or if you are on the main profile screen** (:doc:`ref<conceptsAndTerms>`)  and you have more than one surveys that you develop simultaneously, a list of surveys will appear here.
	
	  1. Find the survey you want to edit from the list of surveys provided and click on the |edit| button, next to it.click on the |edit| button, next to the survey you want to edit.

	  2. This will take you to the **Edit** screen, shown below:
 
	  .. image:: ../_static/user/editSurveyScreen.png
		 :align: center
   
	  3. On that screen, amend any field details according to your needs. 

	  4. By clicking on the links **CSS Styles** and **Javascript**, two boxes will appear, allowing you to type your own CSS Styles or JavaScript code respectively.

	  5. You can also change which of your survey pages will be the first page, by selecting one from the dropdown menu under the title **First page**.
	
	  6. Following the above, you have the option to add notifications, in effect alerts, to the survey, to ensure that you get a message through your e-mail address when a specific survey threshold has been passed. This can be a number of days or of participants thats has been reached.
	
	  7. To add a notification, click on the button as shown in the screenshot below, encircled in a green dashed circle:
	
	  .. image:: ../_static/user/notificationsExampleOne.png
	     :align: center
	   
	  8. A notification will then be added, auto-populating the e-mail address field with the e-mail address you specified when you setup your account on the Experiment Support System. An example is shown in the screenshot below:
	
	  .. image:: ../_static/user/addedNotificationExample.png
	     :align: center
	
	  9. To remove the notification added, click on the button encircled, in the above screenshot, with a red circle.
	
	  10. Also notice that the system defaults to the notification *Every xxx number of days*. To change this to the notification that corresponds to the number of participants to your survey, click on the drop-down menu button as shown in the screenshot below and then change the number under the field *Time or Count* to an appropriate number:
	
	  .. image:: ../_static/user/notificationsOptions.png
	     :align: center

	  11. When you are happy with the changes you made, click on the |update| button. Otherwise, click on the |dontUpdate| button. In any case, you will be re-directed to the **home page** (:doc:`ref<conceptsAndTerms>`)  of the survey you are developing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  
	(c) **If you already are in the survey you need to edit**, click on the |edit| button of the **Manipulation buttons** (:doc:`ref<survey_home_page_elements>`), above the title of the survey. Then, simply follow the steps of option(b) mentioned further above.

Duplicating a survey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
