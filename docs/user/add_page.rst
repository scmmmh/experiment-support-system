   The following section assumes that you now know how to navigate to a specific survey on the relevant list or to a specific question in that survey. If you are not sure how to do this, please refer to the sub-section *Navigating within the Experiment Support System*, located at the bottom-half of the section :doc:`Access the Experiment Support System<access_Questionnaire>`.

This section explains how to add a new page on a survey under development. 

How to add a new page
-----------------------

   - As shown in the section *Creating a survey*, an |addPage| button is included within the **Manipulation buttons** (:doc:`ref<survey_home_page_elements>`) of that screen. Click on that button to add a new page in the survey under development. By doing this, the **Add a Page** screen will appear as shown below:

   .. image:: ../_static/user/addPageScreen.png   
      :align: center  
   
   - When the above screen appears, type the required information in the fields *Name* and *Title* and click on the |add| button, if you have decided to keep that page, or on the |dontAdd| button, if you decided you want to discard it. 

   - Upon clicking the |add| button, you will be directed to the **Edit** screen for that page, an example of which is demonstrated below:

   .. image:: ../_static/user/pageEditScreen.png   
      :align: center
