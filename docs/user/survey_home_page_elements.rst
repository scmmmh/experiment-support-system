Survey home page elements
=========================

In this chapter, we will present and explain the different elements of the Survey **home page** (:doc:`ref<conceptsAndTerms>`), as this will allow you to better understand the sets of instructions that follow and will assist you in familiarising yourself with the architecture of the **home page** (:doc:`ref<conceptsAndTerms>`).

An explanation of the survey home page elements
-----------------------------------------------

	The following elements constitute the survey **home page** (:doc:`ref<conceptsAndTerms>`) and are demonstrated in the screenshot after the table below:
