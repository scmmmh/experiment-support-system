   - As shown in the section *Creating a survey*, an |addPage| button is included within the *Manipulation buttons* (:doc:`ref<survey_home_page_elements>`) of that screen.

      :align: center  
   
   - When the above screen appears, type the required information in the fields *Name* and *Title* and click on the |add| button, if you have decided to keep that page, or on the |dontAdd| button, if you decided you want to discard it. 

   - Upon clicking the |add| button, you will be directed to the *Edit* screen for that page, an example of which is demonstrated below:
