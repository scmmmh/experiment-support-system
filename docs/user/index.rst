.. admonition:: *A few words before we start ...*

	
	PyQuestionnaire is a survey system that allows you (*the User*) to build a survey from scratch or import one that you have previously developed using XML. 
	   
	If you do decide that you want to use the system's functions to build a survey, the system provides you with basic tools to:
		
	* create a survey
	* edit the questions added
	* manipulate the data acquired when the survey is live
	* as well as the option to test your survey before going live 
		
	The above list is, of course, not exhaustive. There are many more functions that we think you would find useful when setting up your experiments. For example, the system also allows you to use JavaScript and CSS customising your surveys to your needs.

	We do hope, we are actually sure, that you will find this system useful and exciting as we did when we built it.

	So, go on...Have a look in the contents below !!
