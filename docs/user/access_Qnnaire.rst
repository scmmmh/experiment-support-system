- As mentioned above, the main profile screen automatically appears each time you login in PyQuestionnaire. 
  
  However, if you already are in a survey that you are developing, there are two ways to reach the profile screen:
  
  1. Use the *Breadcrumbs* (:doc:`ref<survey_home_page_elements>`), located on the top left corner of your screen, by clicking on the link *All my surveys*.
  
  2. The other way is to click on the link |allSurveys| , which is part of the *Navigation tabs* (:doc:`ref<survey_home_page_elements>`) located below the *Breadcrumbs* (:doc:`ref<survey_home_page_elements>`).
