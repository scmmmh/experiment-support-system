  click on the "+" button. You can then specify the e-mail address that the
  notification is sent to, the event (either at specific intervals or when a
  minimum number of :term:`participants` have participated) that causes the
  notification to be sent, and the time interval or number of
  :term:`participants` for the event.
  
  You can specify multiple notifications. To delete a notification, click on
  the "-" button next to the notification you wish to delete.

  Tick the checkbox to have your experiment show up on the main landing page
  when you run it.

changes and go back to the experiment overview page, click on the "Don't
